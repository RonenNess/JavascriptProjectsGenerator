Things to add:

- add grunt basic files as optional.
- when upgrading version, don't replace the curr_version.txt content, but add another line in the end. this will keep track of all the versions history.
- put all the build metadata files (files_list, curr_version, minifier, etc) in a folder (build_utils).
